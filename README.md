**NAG: A Simplified SQL Compiler for Python**

**INTRODUCTION**

> NAG is a Python-based SQL language compiler designed to offer a more accessible and intuitive alternative to traditional SQL syntax for novice programmers. Developed by Lalith Adhithiya, Rishikesh Renjit, and Arjun Rajagopal, students from Class 12 A and B at Indian Educational School Kuwait, NAG aims to streamline the process of interacting with databases within Python environments.

**KEY FEATURES**

> **Simplified Syntax**: NAG employs a more natural language-based syntax, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries. This makes it easier for beginners to understand and use.
> **Python Integration**: NAG seamlessly integrates with Python, allowing programmers to leverage the power of both languages within their applications.
> **Gemini AI Integration**: The project utilizes Gemini AI to enhance its capabilities, potentially providing intelligent suggestions and optimizations.
> **MySQL Compatibility**: NAG strives to be a near-perfect replica of MySQL syntax, ensuring compatibility with existing MySQL databases and tools.


**GOALS**

> **Eliminate MySQL Syntax**: NAG aims to provide a more user-friendly alternative to traditional SQL syntax, making it easier for programmers to work with databases.
> **Enhance Programming Experience**: By simplifying the database interaction process, NAG seeks to improve the overall programming experience, especially for those new to SQL.
> **Promote Accessibility**: NAG's intuitive syntax and ease of use make it a valuable tool for a wider range of programmers, including those with limited SQL knowledge.

**TEAM MEMBERS**

> Lalith Adhithiya Saravanan
> Rishikesh Renjit
> Arjun Rajagopal
**Note**: This project is an independent endeavor, and other programmers are encouraged to contribute to its development and expansion.

**CONCLUSION**

> NAG represents a promising step towards making database interactions more accessible and efficient for Python programmers. By providing a simplified SQL syntax and leveraging the power of AI, NAG has the potential to significantly enhance the programming experience and lower the barrier of entry for those interested in working with databases.
